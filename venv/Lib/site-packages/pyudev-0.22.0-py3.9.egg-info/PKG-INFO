        pyudev is a LGPL_ licensed, pure Python_ binding for libudev_, the device and
        hardware management and information library for Linux.  It supports almost all
        libudev_ functionality. You can enumerate devices, query device properties and
        attributes or monitor devices, including asynchronous monitoring with threads,
        or within the event loops of Qt, Glib or wxPython.
        
        The binding supports CPython_ 2 (2.6 or newer) and 3 (3.1 or newer), and PyPy_
        1.5 or newer.  It is tested against udev 151 or newer, earlier versions of udev
        as found on dated Linux systems may work, but are not officially supported.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Usage of pyudev is quite simply thanks to the power of the underlying udev
        library. Getting the labels of all partitions just takes a few lines:
        
        >>> import pyudev
        >>> context = pyudev.Context()
        >>> for device in context.list_devices(subsystem='block', DEVTYPE='partition'):
        ...     print(device.get('ID_FS_LABEL', 'unlabeled partition'))
        ...
        boot
        swap
        system

        Development
        -----------
        
        The source code is hosted on GitHub_::
        
           git clone git://github.com/pyudev/pyudev.git
        
        Please fork the repository and send pull requests with your fixes or new
        features, but respect the following guidelines:
        
        - Read `how to properly contribute to open source projects on GitHub
          <http://gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request/>`_.
        - Understand the `branching model
          <http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>`_.
        - Use a topic branch based on the ``develop`` branch to easily amend a pull
          request later, if necessary.
        - Write `good commit messages
          <http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html>`_.
        - Squash commits on the topic branch before opening a pull request.
        - Respect :pep:`8` (use pep8_ to check your coding style compliance).
        - Add unit tests if possible (refer to the `testsuite documentation
          <http://pyudev.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tests/index.html>`_).
        - Add API documentation in docstrings.
        - Open a `pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`_
          that relates to but one subject with a clear title and description in
          grammatically correct, complete sentences.
